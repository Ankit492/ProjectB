        <h4 align=center>‚ù§Ô∏èHappy Birthday Babe‚ù§Ô∏è</h4>
        <p>Firstly many many many Happy returns of the day babe.üéÇüç∞ This day is more special to me than it is to you. All i wanted and wished for is to be with you on this day and make your day more special with everything I can do. But the nature planned something else.. no worries and no more regretting thought from now.. I just wana say that how much I love you‚ù§Ô∏è and how much your presence in my life makes me feel special.

I feel special just to have you in my life not just Bragging but seriously your nature is something I personally loved the best among everyone i ever met.

My Love towards you always increases day by day..Like you have some sort of magic within yourself that whenever i see you i cannot control myself and I am saying truely that everytime i see you I feel the same crazy and special feeling inside me that came the very first time.

You have taken over my body, soul and my mind completly..like my dreams are full of meri vaishu ke sath bike ride, vaishu ke sath kiss, vaishu ke sath time spend, love, making out, fighting and fear about some stuffs even in my dream.

Mostly My face starts smiling and my stomach starts trumbling whenever a single thought of you comes to my mind.

Today is your day babe I want you to spend your entire day with a small smile on your face. Koi bhi agar aaj meri babe ko sad karega na ...usko sidha ek paune kilo ka punch dena apna üòâ.

I wana tell you that I love You soooo sooo sooo much‚ù§Ô∏è and I can never ever afford to loose you. Your presence means a lot to me and I will die trying being better for you and making you happy.
